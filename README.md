This repository contains the code that was used to generate the graphs and analysis in my final paper for the Urban Political Economy class (ECON 345). A live version of my paper can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDZullYuAkU_z7uGvRI1SySAqooAuxUP/view?usp=sharing). The data used for the analysis and present in this repository was collected from [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) and [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/).
